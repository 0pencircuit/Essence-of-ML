## Welcome to Essence of ML

Our end goal is to create a complete reference for learning Machine Learning. One thing that we have noticed in our journey with ML is that you can't always learn everything from a single resource. Extensive research needs to be done until you find the explanation that 'clicks' with you. We have searched and found several of such resources and have tried to create a culmination of all the information from these resources to create an ideal hub all of the beginner friendly content on Machine Learning.

You can contribute to this attempt as you wish. After all, no information should be forbidden. Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fillerInk/Essence-of-ML/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
