# Essence of ML

Our end goal is to create a complete reference for learning Machine Learning. One thing that we have noticed in our journey with ML is that you can't always learn everything from a single resource. Extensive research needs to be done until you find the explanation that 'clicks' with you. We have searched and found several of such resources and have tried to create a culmination of all the information from these resources to create an ideal hub all of the beginner friendly content on Machine Learning.

## Introduction

Most people when they hear 'Artificial Intelligence' picture some sort of super-villain robot trying to take over the world. Well, this might be how the most of us first came acroos artificial intelligence, through movies. But artificial intelligence is not something from the fantasies of the far future. It is already here and it is affecting the way we live and how we think and do things already. 

This is a small attempt to take the absolute layman through the various intricacies of the field and its subsets. What we know and how much we have come from the beginning. So it doesn't matter if you have no previous experience, in computer science or in engineering at all. 

Artificial intelligence, as said earlier, is already all around us. From email spam filters to YouTube recommendations to better recognition of your voice by the various voice search apps. Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, one of its subsets, is already changing how we view and percieve the staggering amount of data around us. So while this revolution is taking place don't you want to take part in it too? That is the one goal of this open-source textbook. 

## Chapter 1 : Jargon

So we hear a lot of words these days, which are used almost interchangably(wrong!). We talk about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and so on. But do you exactly know what all of these jargon actually mean? The first chapter is dedicated to learn these words, along with some others. After you are finished with this chapter, you will be able to explain clearly what each of these means and also get a big picture of all the different fields of study and how they are connected.
